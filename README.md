# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## What I Learned

In this assignment I learnet how to set up a react. as well as using Git to make branches and also to merger branches when it is completed. I also learned that branches still retain its content of what was done within them even after being merged

# Assignment 1

## Components Structure

- BlogPost: Individual blog post display
- BlogList: Container for multiple posts
- Header: Navigation and site title

## Styling Approach

Using BlogPost.module.css, I made some changes to how the contents presents. for One the default position of the metadat, was towards the left of the box, using a flexbox, i moved it to the center. I changed the colors of the author to a reddish orange, so it stands out more in a dark background. the content box itself is black, while the text is a whitish grey.
